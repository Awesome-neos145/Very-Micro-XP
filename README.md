Despite MicroXP being the most well known modified OS that make Windows XP the smallest, I kicked in. I disabled so much, That the 32 bit ISO came in at a whopping 84.5 Megabytes! (Or known as 88,604,672 bytes). and the x64 version is 158MB! I tested it, and it works! Really fast too. It takes up half a gigabyte! Just note, The first time use makes the primary mouse buttons switch.
